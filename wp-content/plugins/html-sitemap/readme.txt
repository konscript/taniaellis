Adds an HTML (Not XML) sitemap of your blog pages (not posts) by entering the shortcode [html_sitemap], perfect for those who use WordPress as a CMS.

== Description ==
This simple plugin adds an HTML (Not XML) sitemap of your blog pages (not posts) by entering the shortcode [html_sitemap] in the page content. This simple plugin is configured from the shortcode. Settings include the `sort_column`, `sort_order`, `exclude`, `include`, `depth`, `child_of`, `meta_key`, `meta_value`, `authors`, `number`, and `offset`. You can set essentially everything you can set in the wp_list_pages function.

This plugins is perfect for those who use WordPress as a CMS.

First example shows how to add the sitemap in its simplest form.

`[html_sitemap]`

Example shortcode will add a sitemap to a page displaying a depth limit of 3 and exclude page ID 708.

`[html_sitemap depth=3 exclude=708]`

Example shortcode will add a sitemap to a page displaying only children and grandchildren of the current page.

`[html_sitemap depth=2 child_of=CURRENT]`

Last example shortcode will add a sitemap displaying the page modified date with the pages sorted by the menu order number.

`[html_sitemap show_date=modified sort_column=menu_order]`


Please see the [Template Documentation for the `wp_list_pages` function](http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/wp_list_pages) for detailed documentation of the available attributes and their values.

= ATTENTION: HTML-SITEMAP SHORTCODE HAS CHANGED =
Though `html-sitemap` still works, the new HTML Sitemap shortcode is `html_sitemap`. The dash/hyphen may not get processed correctly if other plugins use the same prefix such as the Syntax Highlighter plugin.
