Upgrading?
Be sure to back everything up. Since this version adds a significant feature, you will need to re-associate your pages/posts to your sidebars. Sorry. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder `sidebar-generator` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Replace `dynamic_sidebar()` with `generated_dynamic_sidebar()` in your template sidebar files
4. Create a sidebar by going to Appearance>Sidebars
5. Assign the sidebar to a page or post


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can you generate a sidebar? =

Once the plugin is active, go to Appearance>Sidebars. Only your generated sidebars will display on this page, your theme's sidebars are still active and working, they just don't show because they are not generated by this plugin.

= How do I assign a sidebar to a page or a post? =

Edit the page or post, then scroll down to the section labeled Sidebars. Select the sidebar you wish to see on the page. Dont forget to save the page or post.

= What files do I change in my theme? =

Most themes use a 'sidebar.php' file, but some themes may have multiple sidebar, like a side column, and a footer sidebar. These themes sometimes use 'sidebar2.php' or 'sidebar-footer.php' Its easiest to do a find/replace on all of your theme files.
Find: `dynamic_sidebar()` Replace with: `generated_dynamic_sidebar()` 

= How can I style each sidebar differently using CSS? =

Each widget in the sidebar will have a unique class, based on its title, as well as a generic class common among all widgets in all generated sidebars.


== Screenshots ==

1. The plugin will add a 'sidebars' button under the appearance tab
2. The admin screen for adding new sidebars
3. The page/post admin screen. Here is where you will assign a sidebar per page or per post
